Python Chat App (Socket + Threading + Tkinter)
Project overview :
A simple real-time chat application built with Python using 
* socket for networking, 
* threading for concurrency,
* and tkinter for the GUI. Intended as a learning/demo project to illustrate basic client-server networking, multi-client handling, and a desktop GUI chat client.

Features:
Multi-client chat via a central server
Username-based connections
Broadcast messages to all connected clients
Private messaging (if implemented — see usage)
Simple Tkinter GUI for the client (message area, input box, send button)
Graceful client disconnect handling
Lightweight and easy to extend

Requirements:

* Python 3.8+
* Standard library modules only (socket, threading, tkinter) — no external packages required (unless you add extras)
